## User Experience

This website is for any user interested in going on holidays, looking for one single website where they can find a package with hotel, flight and experiences in just one place.
The ecommerce is only online at the moment, depending on the clients wish, a special web app can be designed to have in a store.
A super user was created in order to add the products (packages) and user can also register in order to submit the payment.

The course of Code Institute was my guide during the project.

## Installation
To be able to create the app the folowing steps were taken:

1. Start with gitpod full template and install Django with the following comand: pip3 install django==1.11.24

2. CReate a project with django: django-admin startproject ecommerce

6. Create an Amazon account and crate a bucket to store your media on S3 services provided by amazon.

7. Type on the terminal "python manage.py migrate" to apply migrations to your local sqlite database.

8. "python3 manage.py createsuperuser" will create a user able to add files to the database or create a new database.

9. To run the project type on terminal "python3 manage.py runserver".

## Heroku 
I used Heroku services to deploy my project using Postgres database though the following steps:

- On gitpod install: "pip3 install dj-database-url". This will allow connection to a database
- Install psycopg2 typing "pip3 intall psycopg2" which will allow connection to the postgres database.
- Create requirements.txt typing "pip3 freeze>requirements.txt"
- Change deafult sqlite database to : DATABASES = { 'default' :dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL')) }
- Add DATABASE_URL config vars code to env.py 
- Make migrations to migrate all database typing "python3 manage.py makemigrations" and "python3 manage.py migrate"
- Install gunicorn typing "pip3 isntall gunicorn"
- Create Procfile 
- Add heroku to ALLOWED_HOST = []
