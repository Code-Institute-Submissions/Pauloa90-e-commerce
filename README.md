## UX
### User Stories


This site is for any user interested in going on holidays, looking for a single site where you can find a package with hotels, experiences, curiosities about different countries in just one web page.

E-commerce is only online at the moment, depending on customers' wishes, a special web application can be designed to have in a store.
A super user was created to add the products (packages) and the user can also register to send the payment.

As a new user of the webpage, I'd like to be able to:
- Find out what I can get to know on this website.
On the landing page the user can already see the e-commerce with all the products (packages) he is able to buy.

- Get to know more about travelling from different people. 
The user is able to check the session "Discover" and hear from different people their stories. On this session the user get the links of many blogs regarding travelling.

- If the user still doesnt know about where to go, they can check curiosities about places that the website is selling the packge to, such as Brazil, New Zealand and Thailand.
On the session "curiosities" the user will get to know some fun and interesting things about some places thar the website is selling the package to.

- The user is able to register themself in order to purchase some thing from the webpage.
The user will have to fill a form in order to do it.

- The user is able to choose packages of holidays and get to see it before finishing the order.
When the products are in the cart, the user can amend the order, deleting or adding a new product.

### Strategy 
E-go is a simple web ecommerce to make peoples lives eaiser regarding travelling. On the webpage they can get to know more about travelling through the blogs and also curiosities from diffenrent places.
The owner can negotiate with travel agencies and have more products on the webpage which can be really profitable for both.

### Scope
I wanted from the begging have a webpage easy to access from the user's side, and fun to get to know different blogs. On the navbar there are only 3 options being "Home" where the ecommerce is hoted,
"Curiosities" thar provides interesting stories and facts about places being sold on the ecommerce and "Discover" where users can access many Blogs that post things about trips, travelling and etc.

### Structure
The user who arrives at the main page can see a navigation bar at the top with the session they have access to on the left side and on the right side a Login area.
After the user is re-certified on the website, he can buy any product. To register, the user must provide a username, password and email for the Login. If the user forgets the password, they can access "Reset password" and receive
an email to have a new password. In both cases, a feedback message will be displayed.

The user can simply add the quantity of the packaging to the cart, by clicking on the blank field of the cart with the product he wants, and adding a number (people) to it and then clicking on "add".
The user is redirected to the main page again, giving the opportunity to add another product (package). If this is not the case, the user can access the "cart" at the top right of the navigation bar and be redirected to the checkout session.

OAfter the order is in accordance with what the user has chosen, click on "checkout" and add the necessary payment details, the order will be processed by bands. If there is something to change, the user can change the quantity in the respective field and click on "change".
If the user wants to delete the item, just type "0" in the field and "change" right after, and the product will be deleted.

In both scenarios, payment processed successfully or not, a feedback message will be displayed to the user. If the payment is processed, the user will be redirected to the main page again.

In the Discover section, the user can click on the Blogs most interesting to you and another tab will open in the browser to ensure that the user does not lose control and stay away from the web page.

In the "Curiosities" section, Jumbotrons with images and text with curiosities about different countries.

12. AWS S3 - Storages all the media and static files of this project.

## Features

Navigation bar is visible on all pages and also the search field in a Jumbotron. If the screen becomes smaller it toggles and the user is able to visualise it on click.

## Deployment
In order to deploy this project a python package Gunicorn was installed and Heroku is the hoster of this project.
For Storaging the package Pillow has been installed. AWS (Amazon Web Services) S3 was used to store media files and Boto3 to connect to project to it.
The project has been styled using Font Awesome, Bootstrap and Django-Forms Bootstrap to allo the usage of Bootstrap in templates.

I used Heroku services to deploy my project using Postgres database though the following steps:

- On gitpod install: "pip3 install dj-database-url". This will allow connection to a database
- Install psycopg2 typing "pip3 intall psycopg2" which will allow connection to the postgres database.
- Create requirements.txt typing "pip3 freeze>requirements.txt"
- Change deafult sqlite database to : DATABASES = { 'default' :dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL')) }
- Add DATABASE_URL config vars code to env.py 
- Make migrations to migrate all database typing "python3 manage.py makemigrations" and "python3 manage.py migrate"
- Install gunicorn typing "pip3 isntall gunicorn"
- Create Procfile 
- Add heroku to ALLOWED_HOST = []

### Testing
Travis has been used for testing the project with a "passing" mark.
Please see below:
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Pauloa90/e-commerce.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Pauloa90/e-commerce)

Simple tests were written on the app "hotels" and "products". They ran with "OK" mark.
