## UX
### User Stories


This site is for any user interested in going on holidays, looking for a single site where you can find a package with hotels, experiences, curiosities about different countries in just one web page.

E-commerce is only online at the moment, depending on customers' wishes, a special web application can be designed to have in a store.
A super user was created to add the products (packages) and the user can also register to send the payment.

As a new user of the webpage, I'd like to be able to:
- Find out what I can get to know on this website.
On the landing page the user can already see the e-commerce with all the products (packages) he is able to buy.

![Screeshot](https://ecommercego.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/media/user01.PNG)

- Get to know more about travelling from different people. 
The user is able to check the session "Discover" and hear from different people their stories. On this session the user get the links of many blogs regarding travelling.
![Screeshot](https://ecommercego.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/media/user02.PNG)

- If the user still doesnt know about where to go, they can check curiosities about places that the website is selling the packge to, such as Brazil, New Zealand and Thailand.
On the session "curiosities" the user will get to know some fun and interesting things about some places thar the website is selling the package to.

- The user is able to register themself in order to purchase some thing from the webpage.
The user will have to fill a form in order to do it.
![Screeshot](https://ecommercego.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/media/user04.PNG)

- The user is able to choose packages of holidays and get to see it before finishing the order.
When the products are in the cart, the user can amend the order, deleting or adding a new product.

### Strategy 
E-go is a simple web ecommerce to make peoples lives eaiser regarding travelling. On the webpage they can get to know more about travelling through the blogs and also curiosities from diffenrent places.
The owner can negotiate with travel agencies and have more products on the webpage which can be really profitable for both.

### Scope
I wanted from the begging have a webpage easy to access from the user's side, and fun to get to know different blogs. On the navbar there are only 3 options being "Home" where the ecommerce is hoted,
"Curiosities" thar provides interesting stories and facts about places being sold on the ecommerce and "Discover" where users can access many Blogs that post things about trips, travelling and etc.

### Structure
The user arriving on the main page, they can get to see a navbar on top with the session that they have access on the left side, and on the right side a Login area.
Once that the user is regirested on website, they are able to purchase any product. To register the user has to give a Login username, password and email. If the user forgets the password, they can access "Reset Password" and they will receive
an email to have a new password. In both cases a feedback message will appear.

The User can simply add the quantity of the package in the cart by clicking  on blank field of the cart with the product that they wish, and add a number (people) on it and then click on "add".
The User is redirect to main page again giving the opportunitty to add another product (package). If that is not the case the user can go o "cart" on the right top side of the navbar and be redirect to the checkout session.

Once the order is according to what the user chose, clicking on "checkout" and add the payment details required, the order will be processed by stripe. If there is anything to amend, the user can change the quantity in the respective field and click on "amend".
If the user wants to delete the item, they can simply type "0" on the field and "amend" right after and the product will be deleted.

In both scenarios, payment processed successufully or not, a feedback message will appear to the user. If the payment is processed the user is redirected to the main page again.

In Discover section, the user can click on the Blogs which is more interesting for thenself and another tab will open on the browser making sure the user does not lose track and gets away from the webpage.

In the Section "Curiosities", Jumbotrons with images and text with fun facts about different countries will be shown.

For Storaging the package Pillow has been installed. AWS (Amazon Web Services) S3 was used to store media files and Boto3 to connect to project to it.
The project has been styled using Font Awesome, Bootstrap and Django-Forms Bootstrap to allo the usage of Bootstrap in templates.

I used Heroku services to deploy my project using Postgres database though the following steps:

- On gitpod install: "pip3 install dj-database-url". This will allow connection to a database
- Install psycopg2 typing "pip3 intall psycopg2" which will allow connection to the postgres database.
- Create requirements.txt typing "pip3 freeze>requirements.txt"
- Change deafult sqlite database to : DATABASES = { 'default' :dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL')) }
- Add DATABASE_URL config vars code to env.py 
- Make migrations to migrate all database typing "python3 manage.py makemigrations" and "python3 manage.py migrate"
- Install gunicorn typing "pip3 isntall gunicorn"
- Create Procfile 
- Add heroku to ALLOWED_HOST = []

### Testing
Travis has been used for testing the project.
HTML and CSS validators were used to ensure identation and error wont accur.
